## Desciption
This command-line application helps creating README files become an efficient and clean process! With this application, the user is prompted to answer questions about what they would like to include in their README file. This includes questions regarding the user's project title, description, installation, usage, license, contributors, tests, and user contact information (GitHub username and email address). Once the user completes answering every question, the application then creates a README file including sections with the data the user provides for each. The application also creates a badge depending on the license the user chooses and a table of contents which links to each corresponding section for the user's accessibility.
